<p>To begin with, my family has got 6 members including me. My father, mother, elder brother and two younger sisters are the roots of my existence and I love them very much. To start with my mother, she is the sweetest person and the kindest hearted woman I have ever seen. She is creative, helpful and loving in nature.</p>
